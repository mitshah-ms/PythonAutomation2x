# Create a program that takes two numbers as input and prints whether the first number is greater than, less than, or equal to the second number.
n1 = input("enter first number->")
n2 = input("second number->")

if (n1 > n2):
    print(f"{n1} is greater")

if (n1 < n2):
    print(f"{n2} is greater")

if (n1 == n2):
    print(f"{n1} and {n2} are same.")
